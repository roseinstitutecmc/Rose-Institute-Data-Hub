I'm hoping, for each city we should just be able to copy and paste the following, only changing the city name. Still working on figuring out how to link it all. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd



df = pd.read_csv('citydatademoCSV.csv')

df = df[['City Name','percentLatino', 'percentWhite', 'percentBlack', 'percentAsian', 'percentNative','percentPI','percentOther', 'percentMultiracial', 'TotalPopulation', 'MedianHouseholdIncome']]

```

This is for Calabas, but: 

CHANGE THE LOWER CODE BLOCK FOR EACH CITY:

```{python}
city_name = 'Calabasas city, California'
```

```{python}
def valueFromCity(city_name, variable):
  """This should take the city name and variable and print the corresponding value."""
  value = df.loc[df['City Name'] == city_name, variable].iloc[0]
  print(variable, ":", value)

List_of_vars=['percentLatino', 'percentWhite', 'percentBlack', 'percentAsian', 'percentNative','percentPI','percentOther', 'percentMultiracial', 'TotalPopulation', 'MedianHouseholdIncome']

def printAllVarsFromCity(city):
  """This should return all the information about a particular city"""
  for vars in List_of_vars:
    valueFromCity(city, vars)

printAllVarsFromCity(city_name)
```

...I think we can maybe start with this for now and then extend to other cities. Thoughts? 

The goal is to:
1. See if there's a way we can link all this
2. Fix the graphics
3. Try to gradually expand the number of cities we do and what we do with them
