Not sure why this isn't working. Could also add sections manually. 

## Overview

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="width: 200px; padding: 10px; border-right: 1px solid #ddd;">
        <h4>Sidebar Links</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Calabasas.qmd">Overview</a></li>
            <li><a href="Calabasas Demographic Data.qmd">Demographics</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
        <h2>Main Content</h2>
        <p>This is a page with a sidebar. Use the links to navigate to other sections.</p>
    </div>

## Demographic Data


```{python}
import pandas as pd



df = pd.read_csv('citydatademoCSV.csv')

df = df[['City Name','percentLatino', 'percentWhite', 'percentBlack', 'percentAsian', 'percentNative','percentPI','percentOther', 'percentMultiracial', 'TotalPopulation', 'MedianHouseholdIncome']]

```

This is for Calabas, but: 

CHANGE THE LOWER CODE BLOCK FOR EACH CITY:

```{python}
city_name = 'Calabasas city, California'
```

```{python}
def valueFromCity(city_name, variable):
  """This should take the city name and variable and print the corresponding value."""
  value = df.loc[df['City Name'] == city_name, variable].iloc[0]
  print(variable, ":", value)

List_of_vars=['percentLatino', 'percentWhite', 'percentBlack', 'percentAsian', 'percentNative','percentPI','percentOther', 'percentMultiracial', 'TotalPopulation', 'MedianHouseholdIncome']

def printAllVarsFromCity(city):
  """This should return all the information about a particular city"""
  for vars in List_of_vars:
    valueFromCity(city, vars)

printAllVarsFromCity(city_name)
```

...I think we can maybe start with this for now and then extend to other cities. Thoughts? 

The goal is to:
1. See if there's a way we can link all this
2. Fix the graphics (HTML via chat seems useful)
3. Try to gradually expand the number of cities we do and what we do with them

If anyone with HTML exp would like to help, that'd be great.
