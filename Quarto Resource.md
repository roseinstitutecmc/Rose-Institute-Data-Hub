[Including images](image test.qmd)

[Basic demo of integrating Python into Quarto with peguins](exact_penguin.qmd)

[Heatmap demo](kosmontDraft.qmd)

[Animation on map demo](map.qmd)

[A cool map without Plotly](workingmap.qmd)


Tips:
1. Copy and paste the header into documents. Be sure to add echo: False    if you have code! (That prevents the code block from showing)

2. To insert pictures, do like ![](images/roseimage.jfif) 

3. To insert sections, do double hashtag

4. to insert a code block, do ```  #code ``` 

5. Only put things you want to appear in the website header in the _quart.yml file. If they aren't in the yml file, though, at least make sure something else links to them! 

6. To insert links, do it like so: [word you want to use](demographics.qmd)
